# Httpclient Authentication Helper

## What is it?
A library that helps authenticate Httpclient 3  with services that use  NTLM, KERBEROS and SSL authentication.

The design goal is to be as simple as possible to use.
The library uses default configurations that apply to 99% of the use cases, so that the developer wont
have to concern himself with the details of his chosen authentication mechanism.

The main features are:

CredentialsUtils:

* support basic  authenticaion
* route request through a proxy
* support NTLM v1 and NTLMv2  (httpclient3.x does not support NTLMv2 and support NTLMv1 only with the JCFIS package )
* support KERBEROS without the need for any external configuration files (login.conf , krb.ini )

SSLUtils:

support SSL in 3 modes-
* trust all certificates,
* trust JDK truststore (cacerts),
* trust custom truststore

AuthUtils:

vairious tools
* logging for security
* cryptography providers
* use browser user agent
* handle gzipped response
 and more ...

## How to use?

Example:
<code>
    /*
        Example a: connect to a service on a windows iis server that is protected by NTLMv2
        and has a self signed certificate
    */
        DefaultHttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();

        SSLUtils.trustAllSSLCertificates();
        CredentialsUtils.setNTLMCredentials(client, new UsernamePasswordCredentials("xxx", "xxx"), "mydomain");

        client.executeMethod(httpget);

    /*
        Example a: connect to a service  that is protected by KERBEROS
        and has a  certificate  whose CA is in my JDK trust store.
        The service returns a gziped json response and accepts only for browser user agents.
        also this will log the kerberos handshake
    */
        DefaultHttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();

        AuthUtils.securityLogging(SecurityLogType.KERBEROS,true)

        SSLUtils.trustJDKDefaultSSLCertificates();
        AuthUtils.useBrowserUserAgent();
        CredentialsUtils.setKerberosCredentials(client, new UsernamePasswordCredentials("xxx", "xxx"), "domain", "kdc");

        client.executeMethod(httpget);
        String responseString=AuthUtils.getResponseAsStringAndHandleGzip(httpget);
